  The Cambridge University Ceilidh Band warmly welcomes all enquiries. We are
  available for hire all year round, and have experience playing at a wide
  variety of events. If you're ready to book us,

</p>
<p>
  We predominantly take bookings within the Cambridgeshire area as we are based
  in the centre of Cambridge, but have been known to travel further afield. The
  Ceilidh Band is able to supply everything needed for a ceilidh: we bring along
  a large band, our own amplification equipment, and an experienced caller to
  instruct the dancers so that everyone can join in.

<Testimonial person="Fiammetta, Birthday Celebration, January 2019">
  I just wanted to express my thanks for the music and dance instruction at my
  ceilidh yesterday! A particular thanks to the caller, who was so lovely and
  enthusiastic, really creating a welcoming atmosphere! (Even those of my
  friends who are the least inclined to dancing had a go!) I had so much fun,
  and will definitely recommend you to all my friends!

  brilliant! You were all fabulous!
